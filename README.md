# openMINDS_SANDS
The openMINDS_SANDS repository repository hosts one of the metadata models of the **openMINDS metadata framework**. It defines modular metadata schemas for **s**patial **a**nchoring of **n**euroscience **d**ata **s**tructures.

To generally learn more about the openMINDS metadata framework please go to :arrow_right: [**ReadTheDocs**](https://openminds-documentation.readthedocs.io).  
For browsing through the metadata schemas you can also directly jump to the :arrow_right: [**openMINDS SANDS Specifications**](https://openminds-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specifications/SANDS.html).

The openMINDS metadata framework also offers libraries for serviceable, well-defined graph descriptions for [**brain atlases**](https://openminds-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/libraries/brainAtlases.html) and [**common coordinate spaces**](https://openminds-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/libraries/commonCoordinateSpaces.html).
